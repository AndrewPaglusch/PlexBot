You're now a member of the <YOUR_TELEGRAM_GROUP_NAME_HERE> group! This group is your go-to line of communication with @<TELEGRAM_USERNAME_OF_PLEX_ADMIN> (the administrator of the Plex server) and all of the other Plex users.

If you haven't already done so, you'll need to create a Plex account. You can do that by going to https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/ and registering for a FREE account. 

Plex is likely going to offer to sell you different add-ons during your sign-up process. Just ignore them. You do not need to pay any money to get access to Plex.

Once you're finished creating your Plex account, you'll need to be invited to the Plex server, which is known as "<YOUR_PLEX_SERVER_NAME>".

To do this, send a message (in this group) to <TELEGRAM_USERNAME_OF_PLEX_ADMIN> and inform him that you need to be invited to "<YOUR_PLEX_SERVER_NAME>". 

Make sure to tell him your username or email that you just used to register with. 

@<TELEGRAM_USERNAME_OF_PLEX_ADMIN> will notify you once you've been invited to <YOUR_PLEX_SERVER_NAME>. You will need to accept the invitation, which will be in your email account, to finish getting access.

One last thing: Members of this group are able to utilize a service named "<NAME_OF_YOUR_PLEX_BOT>". 

<NAME_OF_YOUR_PLEX_BOT> enables you to accomplish many different things, such as downloading new movies that you'd like to watch, re-downloading broken movies, and downloading TV shows. 

Go ahead and send the message "/help" in this chat to see what commands <NAME_OF_YOUR_PLEX_BOT> supports at this time. 

Enjoy!
